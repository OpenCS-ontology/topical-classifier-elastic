Anytime, anywhere connection and transaction is the motto of the Internet of things which brings comfort to the users and sweeps the problem of physical boundary out of the way. Once it has come into the purview of developers, new areas have been identified and new applications have been introduced. Small wearables which can track your health to big automated vehicles which can move from one place to another self navigating without human intervention are the order of the day. This has also brought into existence a new technology called cloud, since with IoT comes a large number of devices connected to the internet continuously pumping data into the cloud for storage and processing. Another area benefited from the evolution of IoT is the wireless and wired connectivity through a wide range of connectivity standards. As with any technology, it has also created a lot of concerns regarding the security, privacy and ethics. Data protection issues created by new technologies are a threat which has been recognized by developers, public and also the governing body long back. The complexity of the system arises because of the various sensors and technologies which clearly tell the pattern of the activities of the individual as well an organization making us threat prone. Moreover, the volume of the data in the cloud makes it too difficult to recognize the privacy requirement of the data or to segregate open data from private data. Data analytics is another technology which supposedly increases the opportunity of increasing business by studying this private data collected from IoT and exploring ways to monetize them. It also helps the individual by recognizing their priorities and narrowing their search. But the data collected are real world data and aggregation of this data in the cloud is an open invitation to the hackers to study about the behaviors of the individuals.
